HostControl is a terminal-based desktop application developed with Python and the [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) library. This tool is specifically designed to manage the `/etc/hosts` file, providing an intuitive interface that allows users to add, edit, and remove groups of hosts easily and efficiently.

## Features

- Manage groups of hosts (add, edit, remove)
- View the synchronization status of each group
- User-friendly terminal-based interface
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick actions

## IMPORTANT - Before install

The `/etc/hosts` file can usually only be modified by the superuser (root), so it is necessary to grant access to the app to manage this file.

- **Run as root:** This allows the app to have the necessary permissions to modify the file.
- **Change file permissions:** Modify the permissions of `/etc/hosts` so your user account can read and write to the file.
- **Other alternatives:** You can also use user groups, configure the `sudoers` file, or use **Polkit** to manage permissions more securely.

#### Quick solution for Linux or Mac:
```sh
sudo chown {YOUR_USER}:{YOUR_USER} /etc/hosts
```
> These are simple suggestions that may resolve the issue. However, you can apply a more secure and customized solution that better fits your environment, ensuring the integrity and security of the system.

## Install using Docker

To install and run the application using Docker, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm --name hostcontrol -it -v /etc/hosts:/opt/hosts -v /home/{your_user}/.host_control:/opt/host_control_db nunesfd/hostcontrol
```

Replace **your_user** with name of **your user**.
